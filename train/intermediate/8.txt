Most people hear terms like radiation and immediately think of it as a bad or dangerous thing. It turns out that only certain types of radiation are ordinarily harmful to humans. For example, ultraviolet radiation can give people sunburns. X-rays and gamma rays can make a person sick, or even die if they are exposed to them for a very long time. Some types of particle radiation can also make people sick and lead to burns. Any type of radiation that causes changes in the world like these is referred to as ionizing radiation. If radiation does not carry high enough levels of energy, though, then these changes will not happen when something is hit by the radiation. This is referred to as non-ionizing radiation, which is not as dangerous.

One can distinguish between various types of radiation by looking at the source of the radiation, its wavelength (if the radiation is electromagnetic), the amount of energy being carried, any particles involved, etc. Radioactive material is a physical material that emits radiation. Uranium and plutonium are examples of radioactive materials. The atoms they are made of tend to fall apart and give off different kinds of radiation, like gamma rays and lots of types of particle radiation.
