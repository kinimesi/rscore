The Hodgson family from Texas, USA are probably the most talented family in the country. Thomas is the father of the family. He's 52 years old and he can do everything. He can run for a long time. Every day, he goes running in his neighborhood for 40 minutes. He can also swim very well. He swims for his state's over-50 team! Thomas can't speak any foreign languages, but his wife, Judy, certainly can! She can speak French, Spanish and even Japanese. And she can teach them too. She works at the Pinewood Language Academy.

Thomas and Judy Hodgson have three children and they can all do many things too. Robbie, 23, can't run for long distances like his father, but he can run very fast. He can run 100 meters in just 11 seconds. That's very fast. He can also fly! Not like a bird, but using a hang-glider. He goes hang-gliding every weekend in the hills near the family home. The middle child is Janine, who is 19. She's similar to her mother and she loves foreign languages. She studies Italian and French and can speak both of them very well. When she's with her mother, they can speak French and nobody in the house understands them!

Clara is the baby of the family. She's only 9 years old. She can't speak French and she can't fly. What can she do? She can bake the best cakes in the world! And her parents and her brother and sister can eat them.
